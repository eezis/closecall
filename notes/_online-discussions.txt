I am the developer of The Close Call Database for Cycling. I'd like to make a few points, and respond to some comments above.

The site is not a novel idea. It's occurred to many people and some have wished for it. Because of that people see the potential and they are registering in large numbers from all over the world. This simple post has driven registrations, that's how I found it. So what's new here is not the idea, but that something is finally being done about it.

The primary goal of the site is to stop dangerous motorists that are serial offenders. Those drivers don't seem to think like you and I do, but that doesn't mean that are irrational. They are making calculated choices and repeating their actions because it is somehow gratifying to them and they think they can get away with it.  Within a few years, I hope that on-bike cameras are cheap and ubiquitous, because those will help.
