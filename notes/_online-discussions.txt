I am the developer of The Close Call Database for Cycling. I'd like to make a few points, and respond to some comments above.

The site is not a novel idea. It's occurred to many people and some have wished for it. Because of that people see the potential and they are registering in large numbers from all over the world. This simple post has driven registrations, that's how I found it. So what's new here is not the idea, but that something is finally being done about it.

The primary goal of the site is to stop dangerous motorists that are serial offenders. Those drivers don't seem to think like you and I do, but that doesn't mean that are irrational. They are making calculated choices and repeating their actions because it is somehow gratifying to them and they think they can get away with it.  Within a few years, I hope that on-bike cameras are cheap and ubiquitous, because those will help.

Hi, am the developer of the site. This post spawned a lot of traffic and registrations so I was curious to see what was being said.  I am pressed for time but would like to make a few comments.

First, FBinNY has a legitimate concern, "It could be a useful tool, but I don't expect it will be. Unfortunately, as so often happens with similar stuff, "aggressive" will be defined down and the site will be cluttered with minor offenses posted by "cyclists' rights" types who find almost any driver behavior offensive." I have eye on that issue already and I think I will introduce a process flow to help users categorize the reports. I think over time, users will start to understand how things are prioritized and why.  People have adopted the site so quickly that I am a bit behind on that issue but it is one of my highest priorities.

There is one comment here, however, that I find disturbing;  it's in the vein of Paul Krugman's style (why criticize an idea on its merits when you can simply recast it into a vulgar form and then attack that concept instead):

"the idea of internet sites for people to report on the bad behavior of their fellow citizens doesn't really seem representative of the sort of society in which I'd prefer to live."

In reply, I say that the sort of society in which I'd prefer to live doesn't include someone nearly killing me by swerving a 4,000 pound vehicle two feet into the bike lane at 60 mph in order to "send a message" that cyclists don't belong on the road. And I am trying to do something about that.

Thoughtful suggestions/criticisms/ideas are welcome, but I just don't have time to circle back to forums all over the world and would appreciate them at -> closecalldatabase@gmail.com
