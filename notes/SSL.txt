My nginx.conf is not in the default it is:

    /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

My default root is not /var/www/html it is . .

    root /home/eezis/sites/closecall/nginx-root;


====



sudo letsencrypt certonly -a webroot --webroot-path=/var/www/html -d example.com -d www.example.com


sudo letsencrypt certonly -a webroot --webroot-path=/home/eezis/sites/closecall/nginx-root -d closecalldatabase.com -d www.closecalldatabase.com

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - If you lose your account credentials, you can recover through
   e-mails sent to ernest.ezis@gmail.com.
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/closecalldatabase.com/fullchain.pem. Your
   cert will expire on 2017-04-21. To obtain a new version of the
   certificate in the future, simply run Let's Encrypt again.
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Let's Encrypt
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Let's
   Encrypt so making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
 - If you like Let's Encrypt, please consider supporting our work by:

   Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
   Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le

   ---------

   After obtaining the cert, you will have the following PEM-encoded files:

cert.pem: Your domain's certificate
chain.pem: The Let's Encrypt chain certificate
fullchain.pem: cert.pem and chain.pem combined
privkey.pem: Your certificate's private key


It's important that you are aware of the location of the certificate files that were just created, so you can use them in your web server configuration. The files themselves are placed in a subdirectory in /etc/letsencrypt/archive. However, Let's Encrypt creates symbolic links to the most recent certificate files in the /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain_name directory. Because the links will always point to the most recent certificate files, this is the path that you should use to refer to your certificate files.

---

 In a moment, you will configure your web server to use fullchain.pem as the certificate file, and privkey.pem as the certificate key file.

CERTIFICATE FILE ==> fullchain.pem
CERTIFICATE KEY FILE ==> privkey.pem

Generate Strong Diffie-Hellman Group

To further increase security, you should also generate a strong Diffie-Hellman group. To generate a 2048-bit group, use this command:

sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem 2048
This may take a few minutes but when it's done you will have a strong DH group at /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem.

sudo nano /etc/nginx/snippets/ssl-closecalldatabase.com.conf

ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/closecalldatabase.com/fullchain.pem;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/closecalldatabase.com/privkey.pem;


======



MUST DO THIS: after up and running

sudo ufw delete allow 'Nginx HTTP'
