Allow folks to add their strava account. Then alert if incidents on their roads? Might be too much work for the benefit.

Have a general HEADS UP section?
================================
    * these are not incidents, but might be useful information to communicate?
        -- someone through tacs on Lee Hill
        -- repaving on 75th
        -- giant pothole has opened up on the descent from Ward, be careful [at spot x]

*** WE NEED TO PRESS TO GET THIS FINE INCREASED ***
http://graphics.latimes.com/la-bike-hit-and-runs/

Fleeing the scene of an accident in which someone was killed or severely injured, as Livingston had been, is a felony punishable by up to four years in prison and $10,000 in fines. Drivers convicted of misdemeanor hit-and-run — typically, cases in which no one was seriously injured — can face up to $1,000 in fines and less than a year in jail.

Gatto introduced a bill this year calling for a sixth-month suspension of the licenses of drivers who are convicted in hit-and-run collisions involving another person. Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed Gatto's bill in September, saying "current law is adequate."

Two parts to the site:

    1. Cyclist-To-Cylist

    2. Public
        - acknowledge that some cyclists are part of the problem (what are the solutions there)
        - house the type of post that Kennet discussed, the weekly victim's story, to humanize the event
