Any chance that bikes get sold with a little booklet that explains the laws?  And also makes suggestions for sharing the road? (it would get outdated, but should have a link to a URL with latest changes -- print once a year?)


Allow folks to add their strava account. Then alert if incidents on their roads? Might be too much work for the benefit.

Have a general HEADS UP section?
================================
    * these are not incidents, but might be useful information to communicate?
        -- someone through tacs on Lee Hill
        -- repaving on 75th
        -- giant pothole has opened up on the descent from Ward, be careful [at spot x]







Allow incident reports



But Accident Reports are their own thing (fatality, and ongoing tracking as it goes through the court system

*** WE NEED TO PRESS TO GET THIS FINE INCREASED ***
http://graphics.latimes.com/la-bike-hit-and-runs/

Fleeing the scene of an accident in which someone was killed or severely injured, as Livingston had been, is a felony punishable by up to four years in prison and $10,000 in fines. Drivers convicted of misdemeanor hit-and-run — typically, cases in which no one was seriously injured — can face up to $1,000 in fines and less than a year in jail.

Gatto introduced a bill this year calling for a sixth-month suspension of the licenses of drivers who are convicted in hit-and-run collisions involving another person. Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed Gatto's bill in September, saying "current law is adequate."

Two parts to the site:

    1. Cyclist-To-Cylist

    2. Public
        - acknowledge that some cyclists are part of the problem (what are the solutions there)
        - house the type of post that Kennet discussed, the weekly victim's story, to humanize the event

Hi Ernest,

Thanks for checking up on me. I think I’m going to hold off until the Governor signs. I’ve got a reminder on my calendar to check it periodically and I’ll need to do a review of the state law pages after most legislative sessions close in May/June. I think South Dakota (HB 1030) also passed a 3 foot bill this year and several are still active (e.g. Alabama SB 4).

I’ll also be doing a review next month as part of our Bicycle Friendly States ranking. If there are other laws that come up please let me know because it is super helpful.

Thanks,

Ken
