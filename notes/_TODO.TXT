Incidents need a public component.


EXPAND incident_detail.html to include the new fields


Incident should have a place where OTHER WITNESSES (besides the guy entering it) are listed. Emails should go out to other cyclists that were on the ride that can verify/comment on the incident.


Allow email or username login
after login, only proceed to success url "home", if the UserProfile exists


I don't really want the incidents to be deleted, they should just get an active = False flag and all queries should look for active = True
Updates should also save the prior version for later inspection.


security:
1. change postgres port
2. SSH already changed
3. shutdown HTTP except for port 80

Get a transparent favicon.ico and put in static directory.


Add First Name & Last Name to the login page
    This is easy. Go to current page, grab the HTML, update it (look at the closecall2 project, I think I did it there already)


CENTER MAP TO ZIP CODE OR CURRENT LOCATION

TIME PICKER



Done
===============

Add [account / profile | logout] to menu, see if I can use a menu button.
    This required a custome template tag so that I could pull the proper UserProfileID. It takes a request.user and uses that value
    to look up the corresponding UserProfile and it returns the UserProfile.ID in _nav-right.html. core.templatetags.market_filter.py has the code.


Annoucements
    made an context processor for that, it's registered in settings, it gets called on every request
    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS += (
        'publish.views.AnnouncementView',
    )



Create a gmail account for closecall and update the settings.py


Access has to be via nginx, so ensure that closecalldatabase.com:8000 cannot be accessed
