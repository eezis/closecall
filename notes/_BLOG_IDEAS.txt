Sure, unless the driver is uninsured or underinsured, in which case, if the bicyclist has UIM coverage, the bicyclist's insurance would pay.

Many bicyclists don't own cars and therefore don't have UIM insurance. That is a problem, but not as bad as people driving and injuring others with no insurance.

Hi Bob,

When a cyclist pursues a civil case against a motorist, and the court finds against the motorist, does the motorist's insurance company pay the damages?

RIDING ALONE IS…

Laurel: …scary, but necessary. Sadly, there have been multiple accidents of cars hitting cyclists in Colorado, a lot of which have been my friends. I live 5 minutes from the National Forest trailhead so I love taking my mountain bike or cross bike and getting lost for hours on the trails.

  OMG! Enforcement in Austin!  http://www.bikingbis.com/2013/09/16/how-to-enforce-3-foot-passing-law-to-protect-bicyclists/ September 16, 2013
    To actively enforce the law, the police department sends one of its officers out on a bicycle. When a car comes too close, the officer radios ahead to a police car that chases down the violator and writes a ticket.
    So far, according to the Washington Post, police have issued 104 citations and warnings. Tickets cost $167.
    The bicycle-riding officers say they practice judging the distance ahead of time. If they can reach out and touch the passenger side mirror as the car passes, that’s definitely less than 3 feet and the car gets a ticket. If it’s close but they’re not sure, the driver gets a warning.
    If anyone questions the police officers’ judgment, a video camera on the bicycle handlebars has recorded the entire event and can be used as evidence.
    Right now, 21 states and the District of Columbia have laws on the books requiring motorists give bicyclists a 3-foot or more margin (Pennsylvania requires 4 feet) when passing.
    I’m sure it would be helpful if police departments in those states issued tickets to violators to remind motorists about the law.

    The suspect has previously been convicted of driving under the influence, police said.

    “In California, a previous DUI conviction, and the subsequent required alcohol education, is considered an adequate indicator to suggest ‘implied malice’ in subsequent DUI arrests involving the death of another party,” according to the news release.

    Stephany was being held without bail, which had initially been set at $100,000.

“I’ve never seen a friendly bicyclist in Durango. At least 10 times this week, they disregarded traffic laws and simply pedaled in front of me, then when I slam on the brake, they give me the finger. I must say, my desire to not smash them under my car is no longer balanced by my desire to not go to jail.”
