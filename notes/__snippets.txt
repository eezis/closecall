==== EMAIL REPLIES


Hi Ted,

I managed the Close Call Database. I wanted to let you know that I have reviewed your report and it appears to be in good order.

I don't think that interaction is serious enough to warrant an email alert but the report will be retained in the database and future incident reports will be screened against it in order to determine if this driver is a repeat offender.

Thanks for using the database,

=====  a 3-ft violation, but not super serious ======

Hi Heather,

I manage the Close Call Database and I have reviewed your report.

Everything appears to be in good order. While the incident is troubling, I don't think it rises to the level that merits an email alert (unfortunately the type of thing that happened to you is all too common and people would probably get annoyed if they received an email every time it was reported).

The report will stay in the database, and future reports will be screened against it in order to determine if this driver is a repeat offender and chronic problem to cyclists.

Thanks for filing the report,

Ernest Ezis
