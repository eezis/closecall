As biking grows in a community and begins to affect cultural and political change, anti-biking sentiment (and sometimes action) tends to grow up alongside it. Cylcing adovates even have a name for the phenomenon, <a href="http://www.citylab.com/commute/2014/09/why-bike-lovers-should-be-happy-about-bikelash/380219/" target="_blank">"Bikelash"</a>.

I have sat back -- often with a feeling of dread -- as the Folsom debacle has played out in the greater Boulder community. The politest dear comment that I can make about that situation is along the lines of, "Mistakes were made."

<p>
The larger problem is that those mistakes seem to have contributed greatly to local "bikelash" as drivers have, in The Daily Camera and other forums reinforced the cultural meme that cyclists are annoying, entitled, law-breaking, hazard-creating, lycra-clad scum that are an inconenience to drivers. Many of our neighbors are also clearly comfortable with the notion that we don't belong on the streets, and we deserve whatever we get out there.

I think we should all be aware and a bit concerned about something. Not too long ago, in parts of the southeast, communities often expressed, quite openly, some very ugly ideas about race. The mechanics were quite transparent. The people making the charges took the highly visible misbehavior of a few, and assigned that behavior to a group. They didn't see a lazy individual, an uneducated individual. They instead objectied an entire group of people and called them "lazy", and "stupid" and much uglier things as well. The black doctor or other accomplished professional was overlooked, such an inconvenient data point must not be allowed to ruin the narrative in a bigot's mind. Much the same is happenning now with cycling.

Drivers make no distinction between a college kid blowing through a red light or a hipster blowing stop signs downtown and the larger group of law-abiding responsible recreational cyclists. To them we are all 'damned cyclists'. When a drunk loses his license to a DUI and can only get to and from the bar on a bike, he -- in a driver's mind -- becomes one of us too. When he rides home drunk and gets struck by a train, he doesn't enter the culture as a drunk guy that got hit by a train. The story is reported in the papers as "Cyclist Struck by Train" and the drivers gather around the story to comment about how unsurpised they are that another "stupid, arrogant, cyclist" disregarded the law and "got what he deserved." This objectification and demonization of an entire community, often based upon the non-representative behavior of a smaller part of the community, is the exact mechanism that drives racism and prejudice. Next time you hear or read some deragatory statement about cyclists, look carefully at that language and the sentiment behind it. If you change a few words about the circumstance and swap our most famous perjorative in place of the word "cyclist/s" you will hear disturbing echoes of George Wallace's South.

  170: “I’ve never seen a friendly bicyclist in Durango. At least 10 times this week, they disregarded traffic laws and simply pedaled in front of me, then when I slam on the brake, they give me the finger. I must say, my desire to not smash them under my car is no longer balanced by my desire to not go to jail.”
