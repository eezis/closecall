    The database's effectiveness increases with membership and coverage. The map below shows the location of currently registered users with some limitations. For instance, it only shows one dot for every city &amp; zip code/postal code combination even if there are many registrants. So at the moment Boulder Colorado alone has 46 registrations but the map below only shows six dots. Still I wanted to share the map in order to provide the community here with a general picture of registered user locations. The site is off to a great start and registrations continue to come in as word of the site spreads from one cyclist to another and it gets mentioned around the web on blogs, Twitter, Facebook, etc. To get the most out of this service, you want to encourage other cyclists <em>in your area</em> to join.
