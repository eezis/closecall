    <h2><small>
    Drivers that are hostile to cyclists are often serial offenders. Cataloging their aggression and documenting their hostility towards cyclists provides important information to fellow cyclists, local police and prosecutors. When you record an incident here, it will be shared with cyclists in your area. It can also be used by local police and prosecutors; providing police with a good reason to have an educational and behavior changing conversation with a problem driver and increasing the likelihood that justice is served if an aggressive motorist with a pattern of aggressive behavior collides with a cyclist at a later date.

    If you would like to be notified of aggressive drivers in your area, or if you would like to report an incident with a hostile driver please <a href="/accounts/register/" style="text-decoration: none;">register</a>.
