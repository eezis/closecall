<div class="question">
What can I do to help?
</div>

<div class="answer">
Easy. Email your cycling friends, encourage them to register. This is a cyclist-to-cylist notification system. It will only work if a lot of cyclists register and act as each others' eyes and ears.

<div class="question">
How is "my area" defined? How big is my area?
</div>

<div class="answer">
The Incident Reports that you see are the ones that occur within a 60 miles radius of your location; where your location is the geographic center of the city or zip code that you provided. The radius reaches across state lines. If you live in Washington DC, for instance, you will see Incidents that are reported in DC, Virginia, and Maryland.
</div>

<div class="question">
Why is the radius set to 60 miles? Can I change it?
</div>

<div class="answer">
I defaulted the radius to 60 miles to cover the range of stronger riders, who are quite capable of ranging that far from their home base. At the moment the radius that defines your area of interest cannot be changed, but it will be fully customizable in the future. So if you want to see only the Incident Reports in a tight concentric circle, you can do so, and if you want to expand the range so that you see more reports but learn more about your region, you will be free to do that as well.
</div>

<div class="question">
What if I ride in more than one location?
</div>

<div class="answer">
I plan to add a feature that will allow you to subscribe to multiple areas of interest. So if you live in Seattle, WA but maybe spend your summers in Bend, OR, then you will be able to designate Seattle as your primary area of interest, and also add Bend and other locations as secondary areas of interest that you would like to track.
</div>

<div class="question">
What's the different between and "Incident" and an "Accident"
</div>

<div class="answer">
That's a critically important distinction. Accidents happen. Drivers make mistakes, cyclists do too. Mistakes and resulting accidents are unpredictable and as long as people are behind the wheel driving, there is little we can do about that. An <i>"Incident"</i>> as a term of art at this website is entirely different. An Incident is when the action is <em>intentional</em>.  In the area where I ride now, a motorist serially harrassed cyclists for a period of eight years before he finally killed a cyclist in 2011. Those are the people that represent the greatest danger to cyclists. They repeat their behavior and it may escalate over time. Those are the people to stop. They think it's fun to throw something at you, run you off the road, and use their vehicle in a manner that has potentially lethal consequences. In short, they are complete assholes (and possible psychopaths -- I don't use that term lightly). They don't think you belong on the road, and worse than not caring what happens to you, they are going out of their way to threaten you. Right now -- Winter 2014 -- this site is soley concerned with building an infrastructure and notification service to find those people. Facilities for tracking accidents and other phenomenon will be added later.
</div>

<div class="question">
Can I add old Incidents, say stuff that happened last year or even two years ago?
</div>

<div class="answer">
If you can do so accurately, hell yes. When the driver here was arrested, many cyclists stepped forward to say, "Hey wait a minute, that's the asshole that ran me off the road ..." Everyone thought their specific Incident was isolated, a one time thing, when in reality it was part of a pattern, there was no way to share the infomation and connect the dots. Now you have a way to do so. And sharing information is what will enable us to see the pattern and identify the most dangerous drivers.
