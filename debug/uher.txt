Background:

Chris singed up on 7/7/15 with Strava.

On 12.1.15 he created an account manually

So now there were two accounts sharing one email:

Chrus Uher
cuher  <-- manual

So it looks like the password for the Strava Account was probably changed at some point, by the new account? Do I enable loggin in via email?

I NEED TO OVERRIDE THE MANUAL LOGIN PROCESS AND STOP SOMEONE FROM CREATING A NEW PROFILE IF THEIR EMAIL ALREADY EXISTS. MY USER NEEDS TO BE UNIQUE ON EMAIL, BUT GIVE THEM A REASON TOO!

USER.VIEWS
    LOOK TO SEE IF EMAIL EXISTS -- Don't let them create if it does!


THE TROUBLE MIGHT BE WITH THIS_USER.USERNAME, VS THIS_USER.PROFILE.USERNAME
